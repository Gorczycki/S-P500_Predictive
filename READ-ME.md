# Mission Statement

Using SKlearn, we intend to have a predictive model for the S&P500's next-day price. We take 7 days of previous closing pricing data, and then attempt to predict next day's close

Charlie/Blake's idea:
Select a handful of equities in SPY that are positive, and then attempt to predict SPY with these equities

Alternate:
Make a correlation between price of the VIX and the next-day price of SPY.

We use a simple regression model with a neural network.

Now need VIX daily close price in CSV
